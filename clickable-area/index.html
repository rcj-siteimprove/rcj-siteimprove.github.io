  <li>
    The x-button is undersized and too close to the image. It should
    <b>fail</b> R113, but currently doesn't because Alfa sees the clickable area
    of the image as the bounding box of the anchor tag which doesn't correspond
    to the actual clickable area and is positioned far enough away from the
    button.
  </li>
  <li>
    The image should <b>pass</b> R111, but currently it fails because it uses
    only the bounding box of the anchor tag which is too small.
  </li>
  <li>
    The x-button should <b>fail</b> R111 because it's too small, and it
    currently correctly does so.
